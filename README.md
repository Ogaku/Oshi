**Oshi** (教、訓読み) is the **hoshi** (星、訓読み) of e-register apps, a true **oshi** (推し)!  
If this creepy pun hasn't discouraged you enough to run away yet, here are the:

## Development prerequisites
- VSCode w/ **Dart**, **Flutter** extensions
- Set Dart **line length** to **125** (please)
- `flutter pub get`, *and ready to go!*

## Deployment procedure - Android
- Install the Android SDK, at least level 21
- `flutter build apk` for your platform

## Deployment procedure - iOS
- Purchase a Ventura Mac, probably (Mac optional)
- `flutter build ipa`, or just use GitHub Actions
